I expanded the interval to two octaves and added more chords with more modal scales. The issue I found is I couldn't get the interval table to update when the Dominant note or key was changed. As a work-around, I froze the key of the interval table
to the key of A. I checked and the scales function fully up to two octaves. Thanks to zskilz for assistance!
